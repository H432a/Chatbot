# Café Chatbot for Personalized Menu Recommendations

## Project Overview:
This project aims to develop an automated chatbot system that enhances customer service and offers personalized menu recommendations for café customers. By leveraging a rule-based approach, the chatbot provides real-time responses to customer queries, utilizing a predefined dataset of menu items and customer feedback. The system is designed to offer tailored suggestions based on customer preferences, ensuring a personalized experience.

## Features:
- **Data Collection:**  
  - Gathering menu information and customer feedback, and storing them in a structured database for future analysis.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the quality of the data used in the response system.
  
- **Response System:**  
  - A chatbot that matches customer queries to predefined responses based on the dataset, offering personalized menu suggestions.

- **Deployment:**  
  - Development of a Flask-based web application, providing an intuitive user interface for automated customer service and menu recommendations.
  - Hosted on a scalable and reliable platform to ensure responsiveness and accessibility.

- **Evaluation:**  
  - Measurement of the chatbot’s performance using response accuracy, customer satisfaction, and dataset completeness. Continuous refinement based on feedback.

## Technologies Used:
- **Flask** for building the web application.
- **Python** for the backend logic and chatbot functionality.
- **SQL** for managing the database of menu items and customer feedback.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the front-end interface.
